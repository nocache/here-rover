HereRover is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows CND staff to choose from the 6 vehicles and obtain their location by calling their API.

It shows the location of the vehicle(s) using the Google Earth plugin (or text if plugin not available*)

TODO:  the tool should also accept manual input of lunar lat/long
     

* The Google Earth plugin is only available for Window and OSX. Also it is a 32-bit NSAPI plugin, which is not supported on 64-bit versions of Chrome (this includes the latest revision of Chrome for OS X, v39 or above) 

Requirements
