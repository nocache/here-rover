HereRover is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows CND staff to choose from the 6 vehicles and obtain their location by calling their API.

The tool should also accept manual input of lunar lat/long to:
     
1. Show where the vehicle is on the lunar map; and        
2. Calculate the distance from the CND Command Centre (located at the Apollo 11 landing site at lat:0.681400, long: 23.460550) to the vehicle or coordinates supplied.

CND Staff are notoriously fickle and won't use a tool that is difficult to use or difficult to look at. This behavior costs the business millions in inefficiencies, as the staff will wander around aimlessly looking for cars based purely on “gut-feel”. 


Submission

Please provide access to a running instance (eg. on Heroku) plus access to a git repository.

Notes 

Secure login to the tool is not required.

The Google Earth plugin is only available for Window and OSX, so it doesn't need to work on mobile devices but it should look good on mobile / desktop screen resolutions. 

Feel free to ask any questions. 


Requirements
------------
  * Ruby version 2.1 or higher
